## 1. Purpose

This policy establishes a clear and repeatable process to identify, assess, prioritize, and manage risks that may impact business operations, financial stability, technology systems, data security, reputation, and compliance obligations.

---

## 2. Scope

---

## 3. Policy Overview

### 3.1 What Is Risk?

A **risk** is anything that could go wrong and hurt the company — including cyberattacks, outages, financial fraud, regulatory fines, or even a vendor failure.

## 4. Risk Management Steps

### Step 1: Identify Risks  
- Teams must identify possible risks during operations, projects, or strategic planning.
- Common sources: cyber threats, legal non-compliance, third-party risks, business disruptions.

### Step 2: Assess Risks  
- Evaluate how **likely** the risk is to happen and how **serious** the impact would be.
- Use this scale:  
  - Likelihood: Rare / Possible / Likely / Certain  
  - Impact: Low / Medium / High / Critical

### Step 3: Prioritize Risks  
- Focus on risks with **High Likelihood + High Impact** first.
- These become **Top Risks** requiring immediate action.

### Step 4: Mitigate or Accept  
Each risk should be addressed by:
- **Mitigating** (adding controls to reduce)
- **Transferring** (buying insurance, outsourcing)
- **Avoiding** (not proceeding with risky activity)
- **Accepting** (formally acknowledging low-priority risks)

### Step 5: Monitor & Review  
- Every department must regularly review their risks and report changes quarterly.
- The Enterprise Risk team audits risk registers and updates dashboards for leadership.

## 5. Risk Register Requirements

Each business unit must maintain a **Risk Register** that includes:
- Risk name and description
- Business area affected
- Likelihood/Impact rating
- Owner (person responsible)
